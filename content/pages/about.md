Hi there.  My name is Derek, and you've stumbled upon my personal blog.  
I'm an IT Professional by trade, but this blog is about me and my life and (mostly) not about technology.  I live in central Kentucky, enjoy technology, african cichlids, puppy dogs, firearms (looking to compete USPSA soon), and love to travel.  I run a small business on the side called [Custom IT Solutions](http://custom-its.com) where I provide managed hosting solutions as well as other technology solutions and also run a technology blog called [Deviant Engineer](http://DeviantEngineer.com).
