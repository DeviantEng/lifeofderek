Summary: I have a brand new personal blog!

Hi everyone and welcome to my new site.  I've decided to host a separate site for my personal blog, to keep separate from my technical blog.  This blog is devoted to me and my family, where I will share things ranging from my home, cars, firearms, animals/pets, or whatever I want...because it's **my** blog!  There won't be much deep technical talk here, so if that's what you want than go check out my technical blog [DeviantEngineer](http://DeviantEngineer.com).

I still have a bit of theming to do, and other things to work out, but I hope to make good use of this blog for those out there who would like to know the "story of my life".
